# simple-icons-pdf

This is an experimental repository running parallel to [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) with PDF versions of the SVG icons found there. Icons are automatically generated by [svg-to-pdf-bot](https://github.com/simple-icons/svg-to-pdf-bot) everytime a change is detected on the `develop` branch.

We're currently not accepting pull requests to this repository. If there is an issue with the generated PDF files, we kindly ask you to report it in the bot's repository ([link](https://github.com/simple-icons/svg-to-pdf-bot/issues/new)).
